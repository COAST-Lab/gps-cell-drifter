# gps-cell-drifter
This project began as a fork of https://github.com/SUPScientist/smart-coasts-bathy-mapping. That project has GPS, depth and temperature sensing, and cellular communications capabilities. This project strips it down to GPS and cellular communications for common coastal drifter applications.
